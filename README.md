# Creating search for the Library of Congress.

## Here is a pseudo pseudo of what we are going to do.


// let's do this is two file for each page
// one for the index which is the opening to the search for library of congress.
// the second page will have its own index.html. 
// give some naming conventions
// homepage.html/homepage.js
// searchpage.html/searchpage.js
//
//
// the homepage basially the welcome with a search the library form.
// the homepage should have a button with an event listener on it.
// within that listener, it will hit the api to the library of congress and
// forward to the searchpage.html.
// if there are no results given, then just come back to the homepage.html.
//
// the searchpage will be called and given a list of documents or url links that we have access to.
// the search page will iterate through that list and present that page with all results.
// 
// a second part of hte search page will be a form submition which call allow you to run another
// search or refine the existing search (basically just rerun the search).
// there is a goback button which is to simply redirect us back to the homepage.html.
//
// on the results part of the page (searchpage).
// 
// During the project, we will be using git branches and divieying up the work.
//
// workflow. 
// branchnaming standard. ...
//      "jason/whatyouareworkingon" for hte branches.
//
// We will create branches for each page (like one for readme, one for css, one of ...)
// Let's think about working as 2 teams of driver/backseatdriver.
//      This might actually help us get through parts we need.
